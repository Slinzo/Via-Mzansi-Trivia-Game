# Via-Mzansi-Trivia-Game
A time based trivia game with 3 levels 
The game is coded in C++ only. 
It is a very simple game that allows a user to register their name which is stored as a .txt file the user tis then associated with whatever final  score they obtain and the  top players names and scores are displayed once the game is complete .
The game has 30 questions and starts off with simple questions with a 15 second time allocation and the after the first 10 questions the difficulty level increases with the time having a 5 second reduction at each level jump.
Vectors were the data structures most used in the building of this game which allowed the accessing the trivia questions from the txt file and also storing the users information which is basically just the alias they supply and their final accumulated score
